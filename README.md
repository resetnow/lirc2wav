# lirc2wav

lirc2wav is an Adobe AIR application to convert LIRC configuration files to wave audio. Resulting audio files can be used to emulate any supported IR remote using a couple of IR LEDs connected to device's audio output ([example](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Infrared-transmitter-for-iPhone-iPod/?ALLSTEPS)). You will also need to download [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) in order to get sound generation working.

I haven't updated this application for a while, and Adobe AIR is not the best choice for writing this kind of applications. However, it works, and you can download a packaged release [here](https://github.com/resetnow/lirc2wav/releases/download/1.0/LIRC2WAV.air).
